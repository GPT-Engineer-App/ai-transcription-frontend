# ai-transcription-frontend

I want to build a frontend for my AI Transcription Summary tool. In my Google Cloud Storage bucket I store the transcriptions and suammries. I want to have a row internface which shows the name of the file, the size of the file and the status if failed or not failed. A summary or transcriptions has failed if the size is 0. Also make another field where the type is shown as a tag. Either summary or transcription
